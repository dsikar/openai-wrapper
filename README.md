Abstract
Synthetic data generation has become an emerg-
ing tool to help improve the adversarial robust-
ness in classification tasks since robust learning
requires a significantly larger amount of train-
ing samples compared with standard classifica-
tion. Among various deep generative models
the diffusion model has been shown to produce
high-quality synthetic images and has achieved
good performance in improving the adversarial
robustness. However diffusion-type methods are
generally slower in data generation as compared
with other generative models. Although differ-
ent acceleration techniques have been proposed
recently it is also of great importance to study
how to improve the sample efficiency of synthetic
data for the downstream task. In this paper we
first analyze the optimality condition of synthetic
distribution for achieving improved robust accu-
racy. We show that enhancing the distinguisha-
bility among the generated data is critical for im-
proving adversarial robustness. Thus we pro-
pose the Contrastive-Guided Diffusion Process
(Contrastive-DP) which incorporates the con-
trastive loss to guide the diffusion model in data
generation. We validate our theoretical results
using simulations and demonstrate the good per-
formance of Contrastive-DP on image datasets.

diagnosis (Das et al. 2022) the number of rare scenes is
usually very limited in the training dataset. Moreover the
number of labeled data for supervised learning could also
be limited in some applications since it may be expensive
to label the data. These challenges call for methods that
can produce additional data that are easy to generate and
can help improve downstream task performance. Synthetic
data generation based on deep generative models has shown
promising performance recently to tackle these challenges
(Sehwag et al. 2022; Gowal et al. 2021; Das et al. 2022).
In synthetic data generation one aims to learn a synthetic
distribution (from which we generate synthetic data) that
is close to the true date-generating distribution and most
importantly can help improve the downstream task per-
formance. Synthetic data generation is highly related to
generative models. Among various kinds of generative mod-
els the score-based model and diffusion type models have
gained much success in image generation recently (Song
& Ermon 2019; Song et al. 2021b; 2020; Song & Ermon
2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al. 2015; Nichol & Dhariwal 2021;
Bao et al. 2022; Rombach et al. 2022; Nie et al. 2022; Sun
et al. 2022). As validated in image datasets the prototype
of diffusion models the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic
Model (DDPM) (Ho et al. 2020) and many variants can
generate high-quality images as compared with classical
generative models such as generative adversarial networks
(Dhariwal & Nichol 2021).
This paper mainly focuses on the adversarial robust classifi-
cation of image data which typically requires more training
data than standard classification tasks (Carmon et al. 2019).
In (Gowal et al. 2021) 100M high-quality synthetic images
are generated by DDPM and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance on adversarial robustness on the CIFAR-10
dataset which demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion
models in improving adversarial robustness. However a
major drawback of diffusion-type methods is the slow com-
putational speed. More specifically DDPM is usually 1000
times slower than GAN (Song et al. 2021a) and this draw-
back is more serious when generating a large number of
samples e.g. it takes more than 99 GPU days 1 for gener-
ating 100M image data according to (Gowal et al. 2021).
